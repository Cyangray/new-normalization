Guide:
This is an example of usage of the normalization code, which takes as input the
output of rhosigchi (in the form of the path to the folder where rhosigchi took
place) and returns (among other things) two tables, one for NLD and one for GSF
including the reccomended values, together with the lower and upper systematic
error, and the statistical error.

1) one creates an instance of the normalization class. This is done in the
following lines.

L2 is always bigger than L1. See ***my Sb and Ho articles*** for more explanations on what's going on here (even though back then I used a grid search and not a MC simulation)
                       L2 = [4,11],             # this can be the same as for L1. L2 will be always randomly picked to be bigger than L1.

This tells how to treat the uncertainty within the spin-cutoff values, if 2 are given in "set attributes". sigmaflat = True assumes all values within the two given as equally probable, and outside this range, the respective dsigma standard deviations will apply. If sigmaflat = False, the two sigma values given in "set_attributes" will be considered as the lower and upper error, and an average will be calculated to be the most probable. See ***Ho paper***

8) plot graphs.

9) Run TALYS many times to calculate the ncrates and MACSs.
9a) First, you have to define "high_energy_extrap": a (2,n) array with energies and gsf for higher energies. For example, this could be the experimental GDR data for a nearby nucleus, or an exponential extrapolation
    Second, you have to define "M1pars": this could be a float between 0 and 1, a list 3 elements long, or a list 6 elements long.
        if it's a float, the M1 strength will be simply calculated as a fraction of the total strength: i.e. if M1 = 0.1, then for every bin the strength will be divided between 10% M1 and 90% E1
        if it's a list of 3, these will be the centroid, the Gamma and the sigma of an SLO (e.g. of the spin-flip resonance)
        if it's a list of 6, these will be the centroid, the Gamma and the sigma of two SLOs (e.g., the spin-flip and the scissors resonances)
